### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Valentin Paris

# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸ”­ I graduated from Wagon Paris in Data Science. During my time at the Wagon, I learned a wide range of skills including Data analysis, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data visualization and ML Ops. I am excited to apply these skills to real world problems and to continue to learn and grow as a Data Scientist / Analyst. On this profile you will find a selection of my projects and other work, so please take a look and contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
